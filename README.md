## Description
This Weather Dashboard Project was created as part of the Bootcamp course with EDx. This uses a openweather 5 Day Weather Forecast API to create a weather dashboard from the Users form inputs, Using HTML and Javascript with JQuery.

When the user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history button area, Once the button is clicked on a city in the search history they are again presented with the weather data from this time
